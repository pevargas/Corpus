           <h2>Testimonial</h2>
            <blockquote>Patrick has proven himself as a versatile developer that can change technology and gears quickly. We've asked a lot of Patrick and despite sending him in many directions, he keeps up and consistently delivers exactly what is needed. We've asked Patrick to use pipes to bolster our multiprocess test infrastructure, to learn/use Perl to automate our performance guided optimization process, and to create an internal website (using Grails and Google maps) to demo/test our US geocoding engine. In all cases, Patrick thinks carefully about his design and in particular, the user interface. Because Patrick has high standards for his work, he aggressively pursues top-shelf solutions that he is proud to put his name on - a great quality. <cite><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/patrick-vargas/40/953/893" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K. Tatterson, Principal Software Engineer, Pitney Bowes Software</a></cite></blockquote>
            <blockquote>Web development experience beyond his age. Great communication with supervisor. Fantastic follow through with assigned tasks. Energy for topic is obvious when working on all assigned projects. Easy to work with, and others could learn from his internal customer service skills. Patrick learns fast, and would be a great addition to any team. Don't miss this opportunity to hire one of the next best. <cite>E. Butcher, Web Administrator, CU Book Store</cite></blockquote>

          <section id="about">
            <h3>Passionate</h3>
            <p>As a software engineer, I enjoy programming robust programs that help people. The University of Colorado Boulder, as well as my internship with Pitney Bowes Software, has fully prepared me to take on the task of creating object-oriented software in an agile development environment. My leadership and involvement experience help to bring this diverse background to the forefront of whatever task is at hand.</p>

            <h3>Holistic</h3>
            <p>As a generalist, my multiple passions lead me to exciting areas of computer science. In my free time, as well as side careers, I work as a full stack developer, from grails and the lamp stack, to jquery and css3. I love to learn new languages and new technologies. This drives my passion for software engineering. With the polyglot skills I've picked up during my time at CU, I feel very confident to learn whatever new technology comes my way. In addition, as an Atmospheric and Oceanic Science minor, and a Technology, Arts and Media minor, I feel I can bring a diverse background to whatever job I am in.</p>

            <h3>Enthusiastic</h3>
            <p>Software engineering is my calling. I am optimistic about where technology is leading our society. Each day, I read the news of what's happening. Technology is definitely a great place to work as it can help people in every aspect of their daily lives.</p>
