			<h2>About</h2>
			<h3 style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Get to Know Me</h3>

			<p>Growing up in the small, rural community of Elizabeth, CO, I was destined to create, imagine and inspire. In high school, I was a part of almost every music group available, including marching band and the spring musical. In addition, I also helped start the environmental club and was trained as a peer counselor.</p>
			<p>Graduating with honors from Elizabeth High School, I continued my path to the University of Colorado as a Music Composition major in the College of Music. After some much needed soul searching, I made the switch to Computer Science in the College of Engineering and Applied Science.</p>
			<p>During my time at the University, I have been very active in the GLBTQ community on campus. Since spring 2010, I have served on the GLBTQ Resource Center Student Advisory Board as the secretary and continue to do so to this day. I have also been an active member of other clubs, such as the Gay-Straight Alliance, Gather, and the Student Alliance of GLBT Engineers. Currently, I serve on the SAGE board as the vice-president and secretary. I also have volunteered a lot of time at the GLBTQ Resource Center as an outreach volunteer.</p>
			<p>After graduating with flying colors from the University of Colorado, I plan to continue my education and receive a Masters at either Stanford University, the University of New York, or Western Washington University. From there, I plan to continue and obtain a PhD from one of the other universities listed or return to the University of Colorado, Boulder.</p>
			<p>During this time, I wish to work part time for a software development firm or video game company, such as Blizzard Entertainment, Nintendo, Ubisoft, or Nitrome.</p>
			<p>In addition to these goals, I also plan on either finishing at least two symphonies and/or graphic novel and/or musical by the time I have obtained my PhD.</p>
